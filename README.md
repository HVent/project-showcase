## Projects

### [Thin-walled Cross Section Properties](project-master-thesis-finite-element-analysis-in-python)
- **Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, PySimpleGUI
- **Summary**: Calculations for cross section properties of thin-walled structures, f.e. wind turbine rotor blades and ship hulls, focusing on efficient and accurate methods.
- **Highlights**: Can display input and output data in form of 2D and 3D graphics. This supports an easy validation and interpretation of aforementioned data. Another highlight is the calculation of warp torsion properties, which is most challenging concerning its mathematical discretization.

### [Kundendatenbank f√ºr Bestellungen](project-alfatraining-java-course)
- **Technologies**: Java, IntelliJ, OOP, MVC
- **Summary**: A comprehensive project developed during a Java training course, demonstrating key object-oriented principles and advanced Java concepts. Features
concepts and learnings after 6 of 8 weeks into the course. It has the form of an final test project. The timeframe to complete was 10 days (2 weeks).
- **Highlights**: Structured using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to separate logic, data handling, and user interface. Implements a SQL-Database for persistent data storage and a GUI made with JavaFX.
