Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Heinrich Vent, an aspiring software engineer with a focus on Java and Python development and an extended background in mechanical engineering. This repository showcases some of my most notable projects to support a swift career change.

## Projects

### [Thin-walled cross section properties](project-master thesis-finite element analysis in python)
- **Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, PySimpleGUI
- **Summary**: Calculations for cross section properties of thin-walled structures, f.e. wind turbine rotor blades and ship hulls, focusing on efficient and accurate methods.
- **Highlights**: Can display input and output data in form of 2D and 3D graphics. This supports an easy validation and interpretation of aforementioned data. Another highlight is the calculation of warp torsion properties, which are most challenging in numerical aspects.

### [Java course project - ](project-alfatraining-java-course)
- **Technologies**: Java, IntelliJ, OOP, MVC
- **Summary**: A comprehensive project developed during a Java training course, demonstrating key object-oriented principles and advanced Java concepts. Features
concepts and learnings after 4 of 8 weeks of the course in form of an intermediate test project. The timeframe to complete was 2 days.
- **Features**:
Command Module: Implements core functionality through a series of commands that interact with the system.
Logic Module: Contains factories, managers, and file handling to simulate real-world application scenarios.
User Interface (UI): Offers a console-based interface for interaction, designed to simulate user input handling and system feedback.
- **Highlights**: Structured using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to separate logic, data handling, and user interface, making it scalable and easy to maintain.
